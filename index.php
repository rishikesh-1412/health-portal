      <h1>Welcome to HEALTH RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>
      <p>The goal of the HEALTH RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is to improve the efficiency of the health by reducing the overall time and cost used to create documents and retrieve information.   </p>
      <p>The main feature of E-Knowledge in Doctor appointment system is to provide the user to get appointments online from a doctor through website instead of going there and fixing an appointment.</p>
      <p>Anyone may need to have medical attention at any time. So we allow every user to register freely at any time.</p>
      <p>Doctor appointment System maintains patient's prescriptions so that their medical details are always available in portal, which will be more convenient for the patients also.</p>
